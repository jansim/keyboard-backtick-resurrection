#German Keyboard Backtick (`) Resurrection ðŸ§ŸðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Fixes the dead tick keys **`** and **Â´** on German Keyboards in macOS. Dead refers to them not behaving like a regular key but waiting for another character to be added, this is especially annoying when writing e.g. markdown.

The present solution is based upon [this article](https://www.foobarflies.io/backticks-on-the-mac-keyboard/) using [Ukulele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele).
